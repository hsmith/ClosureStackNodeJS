This is my template project for creating NodeJS projects that use express and google closure tools.

Google closure is a great tool that compresses your javascript and all needed dependencies from the Closure library and your own library into a single file.

There are three levels of compilation, that correspond to 3 commands you can execute:

compile.sh 
compiles your files into a single javascript file in an uncompressed fashion.  This is most useful for debug purposes.

simple_compile.sh 
compiles your file into a single javascript file using compression and simple optimizations in local scopes

advanced_compiled.sh 
compiles your file into a single javascript file using compression and optimizations which RELY ON YOU USING JSDOC IN YOUR CODE

When you have performed compilation, you can run your NodeJS application by:

run_server.sh
